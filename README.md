Ticka is an online platform that connects users with local artists, allowing them to create and purchase customized products with unique designs.
I decided to explore collecting data from their website, such as product information, vendors, and other publicly available details, to build a chatbot that can assist Tikka's customers.
This project is still under development, but it's open source! If you have ideas for improvements, you're welcome to contribute by cloning the repository and submitting a pull request.
